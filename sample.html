      This is a revised version of the HTML file that was built for the CSS Zen Garden project.
      The original project can be seen at http://csszengarden.com.

      This file validates on the W3C Validator at http://validator.w3.org with 2 warnings.

      Cool.

      There might be some additional elements added to this file to allow for some design flexibility.

      <h3>The Struggle</h3>

      <p>
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, and broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, we are looking to emerge from these trials and tribulations and celebrate new standards being proposed and implemented by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> and <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr> and exciting new features being pushed forward by the major browser creators.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CSS World Tour invites you to explore new possibilities. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the (yet to be) time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

    <section id="about">
      <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
      <p>
        As is the case with any developing technology, it is always exciting to test the boundaries and see what is happening on the bleeding edge of innovation.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The CSS World Tour aims to educate, excite, inspire, and encourage participation. For beginners, this can serve as a great training ground to see what other people have done. For seasoned veterans, this can serve as an opportunity to showcase skills. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external .css file. Yes, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often referred to as the presentation layer, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="participation">
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file. This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the sample <a href="#" title="This page&#39;s source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML file</a> and <a href="#" title="This page&#39;s sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS file</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your .css file to a web server under your control. <a href="#" title="Use the contact form to send us your Sample Page">Send us a link</a> to the file and if we choose to use it, we will contact you for the full archive of your site files. Final submissions will be placed on our server.
      </p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to when looking to showcase the power and function of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. This is sorely needed, even today. More and more major sites are starting to develop approaches to building web content that accommodate a constantly shifting landscape and can take advantage of the latest innovations, but not enough have. Think about a Space Station with an Amusement Park and Museum in it.
      </p>

    <section id="requirements">
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        We would like to see as much <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, version 3">CSS3</abbr> as possible. That being said, it would be classy to make accommodations for browsers that can't handle all of the latest stuff. The CSS World Tour is about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in all of it's wonderful forms: all the latest bleeding-edge tricks, as well as all the gorgeous looking, standards-compliant, accessible design. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full browser compliance is still sometimes a pipe dream, and we do not expect you to come up with pixel-perfect code across every platform. But do test in as many as you can. If your design doesn't work at all in Internet Explorer 8, for instance, it may not be the end of the world. It would be nice if your site was, at the least, usable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum; tasteful nudity is acceptable, outright pornography will be rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View license information."> one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.
